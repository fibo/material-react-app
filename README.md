# Material React app

> contains code described in my article [Create a Material React app](https://g14n.info/2019/12/create-material-react-app/).

Demo here: http://g14n.info/material-react-app/.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!--
### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
-->

### `yarn deploy`

Uploads the app on GitHub Pages, see it here: https://g14n.info/material-react-app/.
It also triggers a `yarn build` for you, before uploading the app.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
